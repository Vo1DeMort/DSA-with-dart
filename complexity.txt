 Big O notation
  O(2n +6 ) -> O(n) : every constant is dropped
  #currently assuming O(n) or whatever related to big O refers to the out put related to the input

Time Complexity
  constant time : O(1)
    same running time regardless of the size of the input

  linear time : O(n)
    the amount of data increases ,the running time increases by the same amount


  quadratic time : O(n^2)
  cubic time : O(n^3)
  exponential time : O(2^n)
  factorial time : O(n!)
